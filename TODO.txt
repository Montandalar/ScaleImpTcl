1. Write a CFF Explorer script 
(https://ntcore.com/files/cffscriptv2.htm#FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE)
that will replace all the icons in tclkit with ScaleImp's icon and add that to the build script.
^ will not work, all PE resources are duplicates of the ones in the VFS, and if the PE resources are edited externally and become out of sync, it won't launch.
^^ No, it doesn't work because when CFF Explorer saves at the end of the script, it chops the VFS off the end, reducing file size but breaking the whole thing.

2.
Instead: sdx needs to be patched to force copying tclkit.ico into the new location.

tclkit sdx unwrap sdx
rename sdx.vfs sdxpatch.vfs
Patch sdx.patched.vfs\lib\app-sdx\sync.tcl:125
  -file copy $src $dest
  +file copy -force $src dest
    This doesn't work! Instead it means tclkit's icon gets preserved on top of your own tclkit.ico!
tclkit sdx wrap sdxpatch

Once we have sdxpatch, we can then overwrite the icon in tclkit's own VFS:

tclkit sdxpatch unwrap tclkit.exe
del tclkit.vfs\tclkit.ico
copy ScaleImp.ico tclkit.vfs\tclkit.ico
rename tclkit.vfs tclkit-branded.vfs
tclkit sdxpatch wrap tclkit-branded -runtime tclkit-for-scaleimp.exe

3. Use ResourceHacker
ResourceHacker -open tclkit-for-scaleimp.exe -action addoverwrite -res ScaleImp.ico -mask ICONGROUP,TK, -save tclk4si.brand.exe

4. Path detection for build script
