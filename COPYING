This program uses UPX to compress Windows binaries after packing with TclKit. UPX
is ordinarily licensed under the GPL, and so is ScaleImp, but ScaleImpTcl fits
under the Special Exception for Compressed Executables anyway.

The instructions for building this program recommend the use of ResourceHacker
in order to apply the ScaleImp icon to the executable. The licence of
ResourceHacker forbid its distribution except from the project's approved
websites, so I cannot commit it to this code repository. I also do not want to
hit the ResourceHacker website with automated traffic when building ScaleImp in
a Continuous Integration environment. For this reason I have pre-applied
ScaleImp branding to the tclkits provided in tclkits-prebuilt/*.exe.

For more information about the specific origins of the prebuilt tclkit files,
see the file tclkits-prebuilt/COPYING.
