This directory contains binaries of tclkit created through the KitCreator
project. The following license statement applies for all of the tclkits, but
ScaleImp itself is licensed under the GPL. Linux tclkits are not used, as the
scripts are installed directly in the binaries directories on that platform
instead of ELF via make.
